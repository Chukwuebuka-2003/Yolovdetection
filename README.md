# Yolovdetection
Using the yolov model to detect classes of contents in images

The app.py script contains code that are used to test the Yolov Model on sample images. 
The code is written in a streamlit structure.

The apps.py file sontains Faster R-CNN, I am still testing with it, but you can try it out and make your contributions

To run the app.py, execute this


'''streamlit run app.py'''
